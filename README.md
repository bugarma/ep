# This is a project for who what to practice English

## What I have done?
I crawl resources from the awesome website [voicetude](https://tw.voicetube.com/?ref=logo) which has lots of short videos with bilingual subtitles.
And I thought people will remember English sentence easier by typing through the subtitles. Also, they can speed up their typing.

## Package I have used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [ant design](https://ant.design/)
- [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
